            <h1>Instructions assignment reflection letter</h1>
            <p>
                Overall I had a lot of fun with this assignment. I wrote the
                entire assignment in VIM. VIM is something that I am passionate
                about and I really appreciated the opportunity to be able to
                share it with people, what it is and why I use it. Ultimately I
                do not think that it really saves me so much time to not use the
                mouse when text editing but it feels very comfortable for me to
                be able to navigate exactly where I want in a line or a file
                quickly. When writing the issues I took a lot of inspiration for
                the format from my QA (quality assurance) course that I am
                currently taking. I opted to repeat a lot of the preconditions
                between the multiple issues because of the standard format of
                test cases in my QA programming course. I think that
                incorporating this format helps reduce errors in the users
                execution of the solution. <br /><br />
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; One major consideration that I had
                behind the scenes of writing these instructions was the variance
                in how the cursor is displayed between different installations
                of vim in normal mode. Sometimes in normal mode the cursor is
                shown as a block that displays on top of the characters in the
                word, but other times the cursor is displayed as just a bar. I
                felt that the hardest part of this tutorial would be describing
                the correct cursor positions, which would likely cause many
                issues for a beginner. Because of this limitation, for the
                commands that need to be on a specific letter before executing,
                I opted to use the Vim find command 'f' because it wouldn't
                require explaining the cursor position as explicitly: before,
                after, or on top of a specific letter, I also have the user
                press '0' to start at the beginning of the line to avoid further
                issues because if the reader started at the end of the line or
                after the designated letter, the find command would not find the
                correct letter or it would not find any letters. The find
                command can actually search backwards by using capital "F" but I
                wanted to reduce error by just saying what to do instead of
                explaining this. For somebody that does not know what vim is
                this approach teaches them something about some specific VIM
                motions and also exactly what it is by explaining what the
                motions are doing after the user executes them but not
                describing the underlying mechanics.<br /><br />
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Realistically I would probably use
                the find command for these operations as well, even though its
                not necessarily the most beginner friendly way of vim
                navigation, and a beginner would likely use whatever is fastest
                for them. I wanted to create this guide, not for beginners who
                want to try it out and learn it, rather I wrote it to showcase
                vim commands that I would realistically use that are a bit more
                advanced. I think I am really comfortable with this format of
                writing and I would like to see somebody try out my
                instructions. In the final draft I could benefit from creating a
                very clear and consistent structure. Maybe I could make a guide
                for how to read the formatting of the commands and maybe some
                quick tips and troubleshooting tips and add Images. If i made
                all of those revisions for the final draft I think it would be
                very good and I would even put it on my blog. &nbsp; &nbsp;
                &nbsp; &nbsp; Reflecting on the reflection letter, I should
                definably consolidate some restated ideas but generally I think
                the flow and the content are pretty decent in the reflection
                letter.""
