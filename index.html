                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Welcome, today I will instruct
                    you on how to use my favorite text editor, VIM. Vim is a
                    free and open-source, screen-based text editor program. It
                    is an improved version of vi. Vim was authored by Bram
                    Moolenaar in 1991, he remained the sole maintainer of this
                    project until he died on august 3rd 2023.
                    <br /><br />
                    You'd be surprised to know that every single person in this
                    classroom with a mac computer has Linux installed on their
                    computer. Writers, programmers and enthusiasts today
                    continue to use vim despite its age due to its unique
                    philosophy, which employs the use of different modes that
                    allow you to navigate within a line, within a word and
                    within a file.
                    <br /><br />
                    Today I will teach you how to create and edit a new file
                    with VIM on your Mac-book. In our case we will be using the
                    "terminal" app on your mac to access vim and create a new
                    python file. "python" is also something that is installed on
                    all macs by default. We will be writing an running a simple
                    python program that takes user input through the terminal
                    command line interface and displays a message. Learning to
                    write code with vim as opposed to plain text will be a bit
                    more tricky and will reinforce VIM core concepts.

                        Registers can save large chunks of information for later
                        so that potential paragraphs can be deleted but kept
                        temporarily.

                        Vim's powerful editing features, such as syntax
                        highlighting and code formatting, make it ideal for
                        writing and editing code efficiently.

                        Vim can be used for quick text editing tasks on any
                        computer without the need for installing additional
                        software.

                    <dd>
                        With Vim, system administrators can edit configuration
                        files and scripts directly on the server, leveraging its
                        powerful search and replace capabilities.

                        Vim's distraction-free environment and markdown support
                        make it perfect for writing research papers and keeping
                        notes organized.

                    Opening Vim and Creating a new File
                </h2>
                <h3>Instructions for finding and opening VIM:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Press the CMD and Space keys on your mac at the same
                        time
                    </li>
                    <li>You should see a "Spotlight search" window popup</li>
                    <li>
                        Type "Terminal" to search for an application called
                        terminal
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Select the application that shows an icon of a black
                        square with '>' and "_" letters displayed within the
                        image of the black box.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Use the mouse to select and launch this application.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Ensuring that VIM and python are installed</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        While mac should have these utilities installed by
                        default, we will double check that "vim" and "python"
                        are installed in your terminal
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Try typing "vim --version" into your terminal
                        application, and hit enter to execute the command
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If the system responds with "command not found" then you
                        should not continue the tutorial and you should seek
                        assistance.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Try typing "python --version" into your terminal
                        application, and hit enter to execute the command
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If the system responds with "command not found" then you
                        should not continue the tutorial and you should seek
                        assistance.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Creating a new file</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Once you ensure that vim is installed you can launch the
                        application
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Launch vim and create a new file called "hello.py" by
                        running the command "vim hello.py" and hitting enter.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You should see your screen change from a command line
                        interface to an empty text buffer (the vim editor
                        screen).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Very importantly, do not try typing text as soon as you
                        land on the vim editor.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Changing from Normal mode to insert mode</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        When you first enter VIM you are in "NORMAL mode" there
                        should be some kind of indicator somewhere on the screen
                        that indicates that you are in normal mode
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In normal mode every single letter on the keyboard
                        represents a command, for example in normal mode typing
                        "dd" would delete the line that the cursor is currently
                        on as opposed to a regular text editor which would
                        always display the letters "dd" if you typed the letter
                        dd.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        try to enter a traditional typing mode you must type the
                        letter 'i' from normal mode to enter what is called
                        "insert" mode.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        make sure you didn't press any keys in between first
                        opening VIM and typing 'i' or you may not have actually
                        entered insert mode.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Verify that you have entered insert mode by looking for
                        the word "insert" in the bottom left corner of the
                        terminal window.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Try exiting insert mode and going back into normal mode
                        so that you can get a bit more comfortable with it
                    </li>
                    <li>Exit insert mode by pressing ESC</li>
                    <li>
                        Verify that you are now in normal mode by checking the
                        bottom left corner of the terminal window.
                    </li>
                    <li>enter insert mode by pressing 'i' from normal mode</li>

                                find the letter that we need, we want our cursor
                                to be on the 'p' in please but instead it is on
                                the 'p' in "userInputName"
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Press ";" to repeat the last find command in the
                                same direction (in this case in the direction of
                                the end of the line) this should move your
                                cursor onto the 'p' in "input".
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Press ";" to repeat the last find command in the
                                same direction once more, this should move your
                                cursor onto the 'p' in "please" which is the
                                letter that we are trying to change.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Press "~" or "gUl" to capitalize the letter
                                under your cursor.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Now that our cursor is in the right spot we can
                                go ahead and delete those two words and replace
                                them with 'and'
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                                The indicated line should read ' userInputName =
                                input("Please enter your name: ")'
                            </li>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        After fixing the issues, make sure that the indentations
                        did not change at any point throughout your editing
                        compared to the original provided code, if they did then
                        the code will not run.

                    <li>
                        To exit vim and go back to the command line interface
                        that you started from
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                First make sure you are in normal mode by
                                pressing ESC.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Press "ZZ" (make sure you use capital letters)
                                to go back to the terminal command line
                                interface that you started from. This normal
                                mode command will automatically save and quit
                                the file.
                            </li>

                    <li>
                        Type "python hello.py" into your terminal interface and
                        hit enter.

                    <li>
                        If you do not get any errors running your code and you
                        followed all steps correctly, you should see a message
                        input in your terminal that says "Please enter your
                        name: " after running the command.

                    <li>
                        Type your name into this terminal input program that you
                        just created and hit enter.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The program should display "Hello" + (The name that you
                        entered).

                    <li>
                        Your terminal should return back to its original state.
